## x) Read and Summarize: Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography [Chapter 2](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec003)
### Chapter 2.3 One-Way Functions
-  One-way functions are theoretical mathematical functions that is relatively easy to compute but difficult to reverse
-  There is no proof that one-way functions exist, but there are functions created that so far we have no easy way of reversing
-  Reversing these would take millions of years with all the available computing power in the world'
-  Messages encrypted with one-way functions are useless since they can't be reversed...
-  Trapdoor one-way functions allow for message encryption; they give some secret information that allows a function to be computed in the opposite direction
### Chapter 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions
-   A hash function takes an input string (a pre-image) and converts it to a fixed-length output string (a hash value)
-   This hash value acts as a "fingerprint", identifying the pre-image
-   A one-way hash function works in one direction; it is hard to generate a pre-image from the hash value
-   the hash function is public, the security comes from its one-wayness
-   it is computationally unfeasible to find a pre-image that hashes to a given hash value
-   A message authentication code (MAC) is a one-way hash function with the addition of a secret key
-   Only someone with the MAC key can verify the hash value

## a) Install Hashcat
I followed the instructions from [terokarvinen.com](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/), they were straightforward.  

-  After installing, identifying hash type for a specific hash:

-  Cracking the sample hash:

## c) Choose a password manager

### Some password managers:
-  Various browser password managers (Chrome, Opera, etc)
-  Bitwarden
-  1Password
-  Dashlane

For this exercise I have chosen [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). Bitwarden is an open source password manager that offers either personal or business plans and both free and premium versions.

Bitwarden is a desktop based manager, meaning that your passwords and information are stored in their plaintext form only on your device.  The information is encrypted before leaving the device, and only encrypted and hashed data are saved on Bitwarden's servers. You can view the information on any device, but must have the unique email and master password combination to do so.  Bitwarden is a zero knowledge solution and provides end to end encryption, meaning that only you have access to your key and the ability to decrypt your vault data.

By keeping all of your passwords in one accessible location, like all password managers Bitwarden encourages the use of unique and complex passwords since you don't have to memorize them.  Since the data stored on Bitwarden's servers is encrypted and hashed, any potential security breaches on the servers means that your data is still relatively secure.

Almost all information stored in your 'vault' is encrypted before leaving the device.  For passwords this means usernames, passwords, password history, URIs, and Authenticator Keys.
