## x) Read and Summarize: Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography [Chapter 2](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec003)
### Chapter 2.3 One-Way Functions
-  One-way functions are theoretical mathematical functions that is relatively easy to compute but difficult to reverse
-  There is no proof that one-way functions exist, but there are functions created that so far we have no easy way of reversing
-  Reversing these would take millions of years with all the available computing power in the world'
-  Messages encrypted with one-way functions are useless since they can't be reversed...
-  Trapdoor one-way functions allow for message encryption; they give some secret information that allows a function to be computed in the opposite direction
### Chapter 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions
-   A hash function takes an input string (a pre-image) and converts it to a fixed-length output string (a hash value)
-   This hash value acts as a "fingerprint", identifying the pre-image
-   A one-way hash function works in one direction; it is hard to generate a pre-image from the hash value
-   the hash function is public, the security comes from its one-wayness
-   it is computationally unfeasible to find a pre-image that hashes to a given hash value
-   A message authentication code (MAC) is a one-way hash function with the addition of a secret key
-   Only someone with the MAC key can verify the hash value

## a) Install Hashcat
I followed the instructions from [terokarvinen.com](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/), they were straightforward
