### Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography [Chapter 1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/08_chap01.html#chap01-sec006)
The first chapter in Applied Cryptography explains the general history and terminology of cryptography.
-  1.1 Terminology
-  1.2 Steganography - hiding secret messages in other messages
-  1.3 Substition ciphers and Transposition ciphers
   - Substitution ciphers are where each character in a plain text are substituted for another character in the ciphertext
   - Transposition ciphers are where the characters in the plaintext remain the same but are shuffled around
-  1.4 Simple XOR - exclusive-or operation.  Either one, but not both or none.  Used in very basic ciphers
-  1.5 One-time Pads - The perfect encryption scheme.  A one time use completely random pre-shared key is used and can't be broken if the key is completely random and unknown to outside parties.
-  1.6 Computer algorithms -
