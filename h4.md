### Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography [Chapter 1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/08_chap01.html#chap01-sec006)
The first chapter in Applied Cryptography explains the general history and terminology of cryptography.
-  1.1 Terminology - Schneier defines the basic terminology of cryptography in this part
-  1.2 Steganography - hiding secret messages in other messages
-  1.3 Substition ciphers and Transposition ciphers
   - Substitution ciphers are where each character in a plain text are substituted for another character in the ciphertext
   - Transposition ciphers are where the characters in the plaintext remain the same but are shuffled around
-  1.4 Simple XOR - exclusive-or operation.  Either one, but not both or none.  Used in very basic ciphers
-  1.5 One-time Pads - The perfect encryption scheme.  A one time use completely random pre-shared key is used and can't be broken if the key is completely random and unknown to outside parties.
-  1.6 Computer algorithms - Three common computer algorithms: DES (Data Encryption Standard), RSA, a public-key algorithm, and DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), another public-key algorithm

### Disobey 2023: Antti Kurittu, [The Story of Vastaamo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T8pJ5SdwOs&t=975s)
In this presentation, Antti Kurittu, ex-police investigator and data security breach investigator, explains in depth the story of the Vastaamo hacking.  First, Kurittu examines the different sites, and specifically Torilauta, where the hacker notified the public and attempted to ransom the therapy information for bitcoins.  Kurittu points out the messages and mistakes that the hacker made, and that the ransom attempt was unsuccessful.  Second, Kurittu examines the Vastaamo systems and explains how they were hacked.  The root account of the mysql database had no password and was able to be connected to through the internet.  There were several breaches before the hack and Vastaamo kept few logs to track these.  Vastaamo recognized these breaches but did little to create stricter security.  The hack occurred in late 2018 due to a misconfigured server.  Aleksanteri Kivimäki was arrested in November 2022 and the trial is still ongoing.

## a) Encrypt and decrypt a message
For this exercise I will use the [Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher), an encryption cipher developed in the mid 16th century that remained unbroken for 300 years.  The Vigenère cipher is a polyalphabetic cipher; each character is encrypted with a different substitution cipher, depending on the length of the key.  With a completely random and non-reusable key, the Vigenère cipher becomes a one time pad.

We have a plaintext that we want to encrypt:  
"Fear is the mind killer" - With spaces removed and lowercase, it becomes "fearisthemindkiller" 

Our key will be "AGAMEMNON"  

We repeat the keyword until it matches the length of the plaintext:  
>fearisthemindkiller  
>AGAMEMNONAGAMEMNONA  

For a 26 character alphabet, A will correspond to 0, B to 1, C to 2 and so on until Z to 25.  For each character in the plaintext, we will shift it by the number of the corresponding character in the keyword.  

For the first character in the plaintext, 'f', we will shift it 0 spaces, since the corresponding character in the key is 'A'.  For the second character, 'e', we will shift it 6 spaces, since the corresponding character in the key is 'G'; in the encyrpted text it becomes 'k'.  We continue this for the remaining characters in the plaintext.  

Thus, the encrypted text becomes:  
>fkadmegvrmonpouyzrr

In order to decrypt the message, the recipient needs to know the key and can thus reverse the process.

"That's it.  You're now officially a codebreaker! As you see, simple substitution ciphers can be broken with frequency analysis.  See you at http://terokarvenin.com"
