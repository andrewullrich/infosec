###  Quintin 2014: [7 Things You Should Know About Tor](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/7-things-you-should-know-about-tor)
In this article, the author, Cooper Quintin, writes about seven common myths associated with tor.
-  Tor is still very secure, even after 20 years.  Common attacks on tor are due to user misconfiguration and side channel attacks on browser bugs.
-  Tor isn't only for criminals; activists use it to circumvent censorship, militaries use it for secure communications, and others to protect privacy.
-  Tor is open source, there is no secret military backdoor
-  No one has been criminally charged in the United States for running a Tor Relay
-  Tor is easy and simple to use with the Tor browser
-  Tor is slower than a regular internet connection, but is getting faster with each new relay created
-  Tor is not foolproof, services used over Tor can still see your communications and Tor is vulnerable to timing analysis and exit node vulnerabilities

### Shavers & Bair 2016: [Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hiding-behind-the/9780128033524/XHTML/B9780128033401000021/B9780128033401000021.xhtml#s0010)

Tor is "The Onion Router." The Tor browser is modified from Firefox. Tor works by anonymizing it's users; tracking or monitoring users is virtually impossible.
Onion routing was originally developed by the United States navy, but now Tor is open source and is not controlled by any one entity.

Onion routing works by first encrypting a users data in several layers (like an onion).  Then the data moves through several random Tor relays.  Each relay removes a layer of encryption until  



### Chapter 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions
-   A hash function takes an input string (a pre-image) and converts it to a fixed-length output string (a hash value)
-   This hash value acts as a "fingerprint", identifying the pre-image
-   A one-way hash function works in one direction; it is hard to generate a pre-image from the hash value
-   the hash function is public, the security comes from its one-wayness
-   it is computationally unfeasible to find a pre-image that hashes to a given hash value
-   A message authentication code (MAC) is a one-way hash function with the addition of a secret key
-   Only someone with the MAC key can verify the hash value

## a) Install Hashcat
I followed the instructions from [terokarvinen.com](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/), they were straightforward.  

-  After installing, identifying hash type for a specific hash:
