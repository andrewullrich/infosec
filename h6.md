###  Quintin 2014: [7 Things You Should Know About Tor](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/7-things-you-should-know-about-tor)
In this article, the author, Cooper Quintin, writes about seven common myths associated with tor.
-  Tor is still very secure, even after 20 years.  Common attacks on tor are due to user misconfiguration and side channel attacks on browser bugs.
-  Tor isn't only for criminals; activists use it to circumvent censorship, militaries use it for secure communications, and others to protect privacy.
-  Tor is open source, there is no secret military backdoor
-  No one has been criminally charged in the United States for running a Tor Relay
-  Tor is easy and simple to use with the Tor browser
-  Tor is slower than a regular internet connection, but is getting faster with each new relay created
-  Tor is not foolproof, services used over Tor can still see your communications and Tor is vulnerable to timing analysis and exit node vulnerabilities

### Shavers & Bair 2016: [Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hiding-behind-the/9780128033524/XHTML/B9780128033401000021/B9780128033401000021.xhtml#s0010)

Tor is "The Onion Router." The Tor browser is modified from Firefox. Tor works by anonymizing it's users; tracking or monitoring users is virtually impossible.
Onion routing was originally developed by the United States navy, but now Tor is open source and is not controlled by any one entity.

Onion routing works by first encrypting a users data in several layers (like an onion).  Then the data moves through several random Tor relays.  Each relay removes a layer of encryption until it reaches the end relay, where it connects to the entended target unencrypted.  The relays are run by volunteers throughout the world and there are over 6000 of them.  Every ten minutes, the relay connections are randomized, providing further security.

The biggest weakness with Tor is the user.  Using personal email addresses, sharing location, allowing scripts to run on their browser, all can compromise a user.  Governments are constantly trying to infiltrate and deanonymize Tor servers.

## a) Installing TOR Browser and accessing TOR network

-  First, you go to the Tor Project website and download the Tor browser.

![2](https://github.com/andrewullrich/infosec/blob/main/2.PNG)

-  Then, you extract the tar file.  I chose the desktop as the location.

-  Then you run the start-tor-browser.desktop file. Launch anyway!
