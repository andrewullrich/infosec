## x) Threat Modeling

According to the [Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/), threat modeling is "analyzing representations of a system to highlight concerns about security and privacy characteristics."  Quite simply, threat modeling is a process where the security weaknesses of a system are analyzed so that they can be overcome.

In his book [Threat Modeling: Designing for Security](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/threat-modeling-designing/9781118810057/9781118810057c01.xhtml#c1), Adam Shostack highlights the four main questions that need to be answered when doing threat modeling:

-  What are you building?
-  What can go wrong?
-  What should you do about those things that can go wrong?
-  Did you do a decent job of analysis?

Threat modeling is important to do early in the design process, but it's also important to maintain and update a threat model alongside the system being modeled.

### Advantages of Threat Modeling

The [Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html) presents several advantages to using threat modeling:

-  Improved Visibility of Target of Evaluation (TOE)
-  Increased Security Awareness
-  Identifying risks early

### Threat Modeling Techniques
Although there isn't one universally accepted standard for threat models, there are several different techniques that are effectively used.  Both the Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet and Adam Shostack highlight the STRIDE method, and I'll briefly introduce it here.

STRIDE is an acronym that stands for:

-  **Spoofing**
-  **Tampering**
-  **Repudiation**
-  **Information Disclosure**
-  **Denial of Service**
-  **Elevation of Privilege**

## a) Security Hygiene

I found a very good article from Kaspersky on [Cyber Hygiene](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/cyber-hygiene-habits) that goes into good detail about cyber security hygiene problems and solutions.  To summarize some of the basic practices that everyone should follow:

-  Keep passwords safe and secure
-  Use multi-factor identification
-  Back up data regularly
-  Keep apps, software and firmware up to date

Some of the security hygiene practices that are useful but might be above the average Joe:

- Use data-wiping software
- Use of a VPN
- Encrypting devices
- Use and maintain a network firewall

## b) Make-believe Boogie Man

To be honest, this task is above my current knowledge and experience to make an in-depth and accurate solution and I don't have sufficient time now to delve deep enough into it.  With that in mind, I'll do a brief, elementary and very flawed survey.


Imagine a online retailer that sells shoes or whatever.  They have a web client, a database of user info and a database of inventory and sales info.  Theres probably a bunch of other things too.

-  What are we working on?
 Key assets would be the customer database and sales database.
