## x) Threat Modeling

According to the [Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/), threat modeling is "analyzing representations of a system to highlight concerns about security and privacy characteristics."  Quite simply, threat modeling is a process where the security weaknesses of a system are analyzed so that they can be overcome.

In his book [Threat Modeling: Designing for Security](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/threat-modeling-designing/9781118810057/9781118810057c01.xhtml#c1), Adam Shostack highlights the four main questions that need to be answered when doing threat modeling:

-  What are you building?
-  What can go wrong?
-  What should you do about those things that can go wrong?
-  Did you do a decent job of analysis?

Threat modeling is important to do early in the design process, but it's also important to maintain and update a threat model alongside the system being modeled ([Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html))
