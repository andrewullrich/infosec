Mikko Hyppönen is a Finnish computer security expert who has worked at F-Secure for three decades. He presented at DEF CON 31 in Las Vegas on August 13th, 2023. Hyppönen gives a history of the development of Russian cyber programs since the early 90s.

After the fall of the Soviet Union and with the growth of the internet, Russian online criminal activity increased dramatically. Criminal groups hacked credit cards, created ransomware and botnet attacks, and stole billions of dollars over the next few decades.

In the 2000s, there was a transition from criminal activity to government activity, as the Russian government either arrested or hired hackers and crime groups to acquire botnets and work for them.  Estonia was targeted by cyber attacks after controversy surrounding the removal of a Soviet war memorial. Malware was, and is, used by the Russian government to attack other nation states.  One example is the 2008 "Operation Buckshot Yankee" that was used to attack the United States Department of Defense.

In the years leading up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia hacked several of Ukraine's power grids.  But since the beginning of the conflict, Ukraine has successfully defended itself from Russian cyber attacks, predominantly due to experience from the previous attacks and help from West.

Hyppönen starts and ends the presentation with a story about his grandparents flight from Karelia following the Soviet invasion in 1939.  They dismantled their sauna and rebuilt it when they settled in central Finland.
