# Darknet Diaries Podcast, _Adam_, 22 March 2022

* Adam was fired from his IT job at a private school due to a criminal history. A few years later, he attemped to access the system remotely and was surprised to find that the network passwords remained the same as when he worked there.
* In a fit of revenge, and worried that he would be caught illegally accessing the system, he proceeded to delete everything he could from the school's network
* He was even able to wipe every device that had connected through Microsoft 365 email to the schools network, such as student's and teacher's phones and personal computers
* He was, of course, caught and rather than learn his lesson, proceeded to do the exact same thing with his current job after he was fired again.
* He was sentenced to less than 2 years in prison.
* Moral of the story: ALWAYS update and use best practice with password management, especially when changing IT personnel and, for example, when getting out of a relationship!

# _Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense_

* The authors summarize Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense (CND) as involving these components:
  * Using a kill chain model to describe phases of intrustions
  * Mapping kill chain indicators to defender courses of action
  * Identifying patterns that link intrusions with broader campaigns
  * Understanding of the iterative nature of intelligence gathering
* Using CND helps prevent successful attacks, reduces investment and resource costs, and gives important data regarding performance and effectiveness.
* Advanced persistent threats (APT) are constantly evolving, and a dynamic intelligent model is necessary in order to combat them##
